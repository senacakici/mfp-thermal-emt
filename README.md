# MFP-Thermal-EMT

Effective Medium Theory (EMT)-based Python model to estimate the thermal conductivity 
of porous moulded fibre products (MFPs), with and without thin polymer barrier layers.

## Features
- Series / Parallel bounds for two-phase porous media  
- Geometric-mean EMT model  
- k_eff vs porosity parametric analysis  
- 1D barrier-enhanced conductivity model  
- Jupyter Notebook demo
